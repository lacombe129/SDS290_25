    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nAttendance\nParticipation has two components: 1) being present and 2) engaging in class activities. Your participation is an important part of the process of learning statistics, and we need you in class to help stimulate discussion. You can make a valuable contribution to the discussion by bringing up connections between our work and study designs you have seen in other courses, in the newspaper, or in research literature. I realize that, especially during these difficult times, you won’t always be able to get to class. If you miss class, I ask that you make up for your participation by posting something on slack such as a question about course material, article that relates to course content, or anything else related to course content. I will record lectures and post them on Moodle, but the classroom will not be hybrid. The recording may not pick up everything we cover in class so I encourage you to attend in person. You get one free absence where you do not need to make up for lost participation.\n\n\nCollaboration\nMuch of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete homework assignments, and prepare for exams. However, every word that you write must be your own unless I’m explicitly asking you to submit a group submission. Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of code from another student is not acceptable and will receive no credit. No interaction with anyone but the instructor and course assistant is allowed on any exams. All students, staff and faculty are bound by the Smith College Honor Code.\n\n\nAI Policy\nAI can be a powerful tool to help us understand the world and quickly identify information. However, it comes at a real cost of potentially outsourcing our critical thinking skills and building a foundation for understanding core concepts. Therefore, use of generative AI is prohibited for any writing assignment, homework or exam. This work must be your own. However, there are cases where use of AI may be appropriate for the class, and I will explicitly note if you can use it for tasks like developing stimuli for your survey experiments. Unless explicitly stated in an assignment that you may use it, all other use of generative AI is not permitted in this course and suspected violations of this course policy will be reported to the Academic Honor Board for potential Honor Code violations.\n\n\nAcademic Honor Code Statement\nCases of dishonesty, plagiarism, or other infractions, will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. You must always provide appropriate citations for others’ work and ideas. Giving other scholars due credit in your written and oral communication is a fundamental social gesture in academic work—a way for us to acknowledge each other’s scholarship and signify that we respect each other.\nFrom the Smith honor code website:\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Cases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n\n\nClassroom Environment\nRealizing the benefits of a diverse space can only occur if we create a climate of psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999). To this end, we will always be respectful of one another. Together we should have the goal of creating an environment where we all feel comfortable sharing our thoughts and opinions. To this end, I value “half-formed,” informal thoughts—sometimes a deeper understanding is reached via communicating ideas before they are perfectly polished. If you have a question, I guarantee there is at least one other student with the same, so please speak up.\n\n\nAccommodations\nEveryone should have all that they need to succeed in this course. Please send me your accommodation letter, or have the Disability Office work with me. If you need to register for accommodations, please contact the Disability Services office at ODS@smith.edu. Please check out the office website for more information. Smith provides flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Smith College Disability Services office, College Hall 104; phone: (413) 585-2071 (voice, TTY, TDD). Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation.\nIf you have special needs concerning quiz taking, please bring documentation of your needs and make an appointment to discuss them with me, at least ONE WEEK BEFORE the first exxam. That will give me time to provide accommodation for your needs."

    "text": "Assignments\n\nHomework [30%]: Weekly homework will be due on Fridays by 11:59p on Moodle. Late homework will NOT be accepted unless you reach out to be before the deadline. Homework will be a combination of problems sets from the book and statistical computation exercises in R. I will be dropping the lowest homework grade at the end of the term.\nParticipation [10%]: Active participation in class and regular attendance will comprise 10% of your grade. Most class periods will begin with questions from the reading for that day. Participating in the discussion about the readings is a great way to demonstrate engagement. Reading before class will help us move more quickly through content, and focus on the materials you found the most challenging. I will be tracking attendance through a sign up sheet each day, but there is no formal penalty for missed attendance. Attendance will help inform participation grades. As a reminder, participation includes in class work, but also posting on slack, coming to office hours, etc. There are many ways to fully participate in the course.\nExams [30%]: There will be two exams throughout the term. See the course schedule for tentative dates of these exams. They will be given through the Science Center’s self-scheduled exams.\nMini Projects and Presentations [30% - 10% MP1 + 20% MP2]: There will two mini projects during the semester. The first mini project (MP1) will be completed individually and the second mini project (MP2) will be completed in groups of three. For these projects, you and your group will be posing your own research questions and designing an experiment. The specific content of your mini projects will vary, but all projects will consist of designing an experiment (or appropriate observational study), collecting and analyzing data, and writing a technical report on your study. For MP2 each group of three students will complete an experiment together. During the last week of class, you (and your group) will create short presentation of your study and present it to the class. We’ll talk more about the project as the term proceeds and detailed instructions for the projects will be posted on the course website.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercent of Total\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nHomework\n30%\nFridays\n\n\nParticipation\n10%\nDaily\n\n\nExams\n30%\nMarch 7-9th and April 25-27th\n\n\nMini Project 1\n10%\nMarch 28\n\n\nMini Project 2\n20%\nMay 8\n\n\nFinal Grade\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nWhen I grade your written work, I am looking for problem solutions that are technically correct and reasoning that is clearly explained. Numerically correct answers, alone, are not sufficient on homework or exams. I value neatness and brief, clear, well-organized answers that explain your thinking. If the grader cannot read or follow your work, they cannot give you credit for it. The grader will check each homework submission for completeness and grade a subset of the exercises. Homework answer keys will be posted on Moodle after the due date.\n\n\nAssignment Late Policy\nFor every day late on the written assignments I will reduce your grade for that assignment by ten percent.

    "text": "Resources\n\nCourse Website and Moodle\nThe course website will be regularly updated with lecture slides, project information, assignments, and other course resources. Assignments and grades will be submitted via Moodle. You should check both regularly.\n\n\nComputing\nThe use of the R statistical computing environment with the RStudio interface is thoroughly integrated into the course. You have two options for using RStudio:\n\nThe server version of RStudio on the web. The advantage of using the server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud, where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you can access your work from any computer with a web browser (Firefox is recommended) and an Internet connection.\nA desktop version of RStudio installed on your machine. The downside to this approach is that your work is only stored locally, and you will have to manage your own installation. Nevertheless, I still recommend this option because you do not need wifi or network access to work, and you know it is on your computer. I find collaboration easier with this method too.\n\nNote that you do not have to choose one or the other – you may use both. However, it is important that you understand the distinction so that you can keep track of your work. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source, and are installed on most computer labs on campus. Please see the Resources page for help with R.\n\n\nUse of Technology during Class\nAs we will always be using our computers to attend this course, I hope it goes without saying that while the class is in session, you should resist the temptation to use your computer or cell phone for personal email, web browsing, social media, or any activity that’s not related to the class.\n\n\nWriting\nYour ability to communicate results, which may be technical in nature, to your audience, which is likely to be non-technical, is critical to your success as a data analyst. The assignments in this class will place an emphasis on the clarity of your writing.\n\n\nExtra Help\nThere are Statistics TAs available from 7:00-9:00pm on Sunday–Thursday evenings in Sabin-Reed 301. In addition, the Spinelli Center for Quantitative Learning (Seeley 207) supports students doing quantitative work across the curriculum. Your fellow students are also an excellent source for explanations, tips, etc.\n\n\nTentative Schedule\nPlease refer to the complete day-to-day schedule for more detailed information."

    "text": "The learning goals of this first mini project are\nYou will conduct an online experimental study using survey methodology. Your experiments will be set up using the Qualtrics survey platform. Your experiments will utilize vingettes or very simple visual stimuli presentation.\nYour study is required to be experimental, meaning you will manipulate a factor and randomly assign levels of that factor to units (people). For this first mini project you must employ a randomized one-way design. Your factor must have at least three levels. You will be creating at least three carefully controlled conditions (i.e., three vignettes). These three (or more) conditions will be randomly assigned to people (fellow classmates).

Your experiments will be set up using the Qualtrics survey platform. Your experiments will again utilize vingettes or very simple visual/audio stimuli presentation. In addition to submitting a technical report for MP2, your group will present a 6-to-8 minute presentation of your study, complete with slides the last week of the semester.\nYour study is required to have at least one experimental factor, meaning you will manipulate this factor and randomly assign levels of those factors to units. For this second mini project you may pick any design your group likes, but you must have at least two factors of interest. These factors can be a mixture of experimental and observational factors. Your factors may each have more than two levels (but please do not go crazy — a more complex design means you will need a larger sample size!). You may also decide to have blocking in this study. If you decide to have blocks, by far the simplest way to do this with human subjects is by reusing materials, that is, the participants are your blocks and the units are time slots. You might then decide to have one between-subjects factor and one within-subjects factor (creating a split-plot/repeated measures design). Creating blocks with human subjects by grouping people based on some pre-survey responses is just not feasible in the MP2 time frame, I hope you see why…\nThis mini project will require you to design a new study, implement that study in Qualtrics, collect and analyze relevant data, and hand in a short written report describing your study and its findings. You will also be presenting your work the final week of classes. You will complete all of this work in groups of about 3 students. Your project will again involve fitting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The project is an opportunity to apply and synthesize the material we are learning in class to a specific context.

For example if we wanted to install Devtools, we can use the following code below.\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\n\nYou only need to install the package one time. after that, we can use the code library(PACKAGENAME) to load the installed packages anytime you want to use them. In all submissions, you could include a chunk of code that loads the required packages (but no others).\nTo prove that you have successfully installed each package include the code below in a chunk for when you knit your final document.

    "text": "Part 3 - Financial incentives for weight loss\nTo get you started, run the following command to load the data from Chapter 0 in your textbook. This needs to be in a chunk for your final submission otherwise R won’t know wehre to get the data from.\n\ndata(WeightLossIncentive)\n\nThis command instructs R to load some data: You should see that the workspace area in the upper righthand corner of the RStudio window now lists a data set called WeightLossIncentive that has 38 observations on 3 variables. As you interact with R, you will create a series of objects. Sometimes you load them as we have done here, and sometimes you create them yourself as the byproduct of a computation or some analysis you have performed.\nYou can read more details about this data but using the ? command:\n\n?WeightLossIncentive\n\nWe can view the data by typing its name into the console. However printing the whole dataset in the console is not that useful. Instead we can see the top 6 cases with the following command. Type the following line under data(WeightLossIncentive) in your lab report by clicking Enter after the ). Then run it.\n\nhead(WeightLossIncentive)\n\n  WeightLoss   Group Month7Loss\n1       12.5 Control       -2.0\n2       12.0 Control        7.0\n3        1.0 Control       19.5\n4       -5.0 Control       -0.5\n5        3.0 Control       -1.5\n6       -5.0 Control      -10.0\n\n\nOne advantage of RStudio is that it comes with a built-in data viewer. Click on the name WeightLossIncentive in the Environment pane (upper right window) that lists the objects in your workspace. This will bring up an alternative display of the data set in the Data Viewer (upper left window). You can close the data viewer by clicking on the x in the upper lefthand corner.\nWhat you should see are four columns of numbers, each row representing a different person: the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index we can use to access the data from individual people if we want), the second is the amount of weight loss, and the third is the experimental group to which the person was assigned. The fourth is the 7 month follow-up. Each case is a person in this dataset. Use the scrollbar on the right side of the console window to examine the complete data set.\nNote that the row numbers in the first column are not part of the WeightLossIncentive data. R adds them as part of its printout to help you make visual comparisons. You can think of them as the index that you see on the left side of a spreadsheet. In fact, the comparison to a spreadsheet will generally be helpful. R has stored the weightloss incentive data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a data frame.\nYou can see the dimensions (number of rows, the cases, and number of columns, the variables) of this data frame as well as the names of the variables and the first few observations by typing it under glimpse(WeightLossIncentive) and then running it:\n\nglimpse(WeightLossIncentive)\n\nRows: 38\nColumns: 3\n$ WeightLoss &lt;dbl&gt; 12.5, 12.0, 1.0, -5.0, 3.0, -5.0, 7.5, -2.5, 20.0, -1.0, 2.…\n$ Group      &lt;fct&gt; Control, Control, Control, Control, Control, Control, Contr…\n$ Month7Loss &lt;dbl&gt; -2.0, 7.0, 19.5, -0.5, -1.5, -10.0, 0.5, 5.0, 8.5, 18.0, 16…\n\n\nWe can see that there are 38 observations and 3 variables in this dataset. At this point, you might notice that many of the commands in R look a lot like functions from math class; that is, invoking R commands means supplying a function with some number of arguments. The glimpse command, for example, took a single argument, the name of a data frame."

    "text": "Some Exploration\nLet’s start to examine the data a little more closely. We can access the data in a single column of a data frame separately using a command like\n\nWeightLossIncentive$WeightLoss\n\n [1]  12.5  12.0   1.0  -5.0   3.0  -5.0   7.5  -2.5  20.0  -1.0   2.0   4.5\n[13]  -2.0 -17.0  19.0  -2.0  12.0  10.5   5.0  25.5  24.0   8.0    NA  15.5\n[25]    NA  21.0   4.5  30.0   7.5  10.0  18.0   5.0  -0.5  27.0   6.0  25.5\n[37]  21.0  18.5\n\n\nThis command will only show the amount of weight the participants lost during the study. The dollar sign basically says “go to the data frame that comes before me, and find the variable that comes after me”.\n2. What command would you use to extract just the groups that participants were assigned to? Include a chunk with that command\nNotice that the way R has printed these data is different. When we looked at the complete data frame, we saw 38 rows, one on each line of the display. These data are no longer structured in a table with other variables, so they are displayed one right after another. Objects that print out in this way are called vectors; they represent a set of numbers. R has added numbers in [brackets] along the left side of the printout to indicate locations within the vector. This can help you keep track of your cases.\n\nData visualization\nR has some powerful functions for making graphics. We can create a simple plot of the amount of weight lost by participants with the command\n\n#try typing this directly into the console and pressing enter\nqplot(x = WeightLoss, data = WeightLossIncentive, bins = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe qplot() function (meaning “quick plot”) considers the type of data you have provided it and makes the decision to visualize it with a histogram. The plot should appear under the code chunk. Notice that the command above again looks like a function, this time with three arguments separated by commas. The first two arguments in the qplot() function specify the variable for the x-axis and the name of the data set where they can be found. The third specifies the number of bins for the histogram. Try changing the number of bins (e.g., 12 bins, 3 bins, 27 bins).\n\n#Create a chunk and put this code in as part of your answer\nqplot(x = WeightLoss, data = WeightLossIncentive, bins = 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Does the distribution of weight loss appear normal (i.e., approximately bell-shaped)? How would you describe it (in terms of modality and skew, for example)? (To ensure that your homework is comprehensive, be sure to include the code needed to make the plot as well as your written interpretation. Hint: The code you need is displayed above, you just need to put it in a chunk) *\nThankfully, R documents all of its functions extensively. To read what a function does and learn the arguments that are available to you, just type in a question mark followed by the name of the function that you’re interested in. Try the following.\n\n#type into the console\n?qplot\n\nNotice that the help file replaces the plot in the lower right panel. You can toggle between plots and help files using the tabs at the top of that panel.\n\n\nSummary Statistics\nNow, suppose we want to calculate the sample size, average weight loss, and standard deviation of weight loss for the two groups (incentive and control). We can use the filter(), group_by() and summarize() functions.\n\n# Start recording in your exercise 3 chunk from here\nWeightLossIncentive %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(WeightLoss)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Group) %&gt;%\n  summarize(group_n = n(),\n            group_mean = mean(WeightLoss),\n            group_sd = sd(WeightLoss))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  Group     group_n group_mean group_sd\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Control        19       3.92     9.11\n2 Incentive      17      15.7      9.41\n\n\nThe %&gt;% operator (now the |&gt; on quarto) is called the piping operator. It takes the output of the previous expression and pipes it into the first argument of the function in the following one. To continue our analogy with mathematical functions, x %&gt;% f(y) is equivalent to f(x, y).\n\nA note on piping:  Note that we can read these three lines of code as the following:\n“Take the WeightLossIncentive dataset and pipe it into the filter function. Only keep those cases where the WeightLoss variable is not (!) missing (is.na()). We do this to keep our code simple later on. More on working with missing data later on in the semester. The we pipe this complete data into the group_by function. Group the WeightLossIncentive data set by Group then pipe that grouped dataset into the summarize function. Summarize that grouped dataset by calculating the sample size (n() function) a mean (mean() function) and a standard deviation (sd() function) for each group. Note that the n() function is just empty. This might look weird, but it’s what we want!\n\nWe can also make a side-by-side boxplot to visualize the weight loss by group. Again we’ll use the qplot function, but this time the variable Group will be on the x-axis and the variable WeightLoss will be on the y-axis. We’ll add a fourth argument, gemo = \"boxplot\" to tell the qplot function that we want boxplots. Note that if you take away the geom argument then qplot will make a parallel dotplot.\n\nqplot(x = Group, y = WeightLoss, data = WeightLossIncentive, geom = \"boxplot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also go a step further and compute a t-test for the difference between Group means to assess if the difference we see in the means in statistically significant.\n\nt.test(WeightLoss ~ Group, data = WeightLossIncentive)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  WeightLoss by Group\nt = -3.7982, df = 33.276, p-value = 0.0005889\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Control and group Incentive is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -18.05026  -5.46058\nsample estimates:\n  mean in group Control mean in group Incentive \n               3.921053               15.676471 \n\n\nAnd we can assess the normality of scores in each group with a facet-wrapped histogram. We’ll use the + operator to add a layer to our qplot. We use the function facet_wrap() and inside we put our grouping variable Group with a ~ in front of it.\n\nqplot(x = WeightLoss, data = WeightLossIncentive, bins = 10) +\n  facet_wrap(~Group)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Which group lost more weight based on the means? Which group has more variability in their weight loss?\nMake sure to include a chunk producing the summary table.\n\n\nMore visualization\nWe can also make a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between the amount of weight lost during the study versus the amount of weight loss reported at the 7 month follow-up.\n\nqplot(x = WeightLoss, y = Month7Loss, data = WeightLossIncentive)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can even separate the point on the scatterplot by Group by adding the color = Group argument.\n\nqplot(x = WeightLoss, y = Month7Loss, data = WeightLossIncentive, color = Group)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Do you notice any patterns in these scatterplots? What might that pattern (or lack of pattern) mean, for the weight loss study? For this answer, no code is needed, but I’m looking for a few sentences to answer each part of this question"

    "text": "Resources for learning R and working in RStudio\nThat was a short introduction to R and RStudio, but we will provide you with more functions and a more complete sense of the language as the course progresses.\nIn this course we will be using R packages called dplyr for data wrangling and ggplot2 for data visualization. If you are googling for R code, make sure to also include these package names in your search query. For example, instead of googling “scatterplot in R”, google “scatterplot in R with ggplot2”.\nThese cheatsheets may come in handy throughout the semester:\n\nRMarkdown cheatsheet\nData wrangling cheatsheet\nData visualization cheatsheet\n\nChester Ismay has put together a resource for new users of R, RStudio, and R Markdown here. It includes examples showing working with R Markdown files in RStudio recorded as GIFs.\nNote that some of the code on these cheatsheets may be too advanced for this course, however majority of it will become useful throughout the semester."

    "text": "Part 2 - Financial incentives for weight loss\nTo get you started, run the following command to load the data from Chapter 0 in your textbook. This needs to be in a chunk for your final submission otherwise R won’t know wehre to get the data from.\n\ndata(WeightLossIncentive)\n\nThis command instructs R to load some data: You should see that the workspace area in the upper righthand corner of the RStudio window now lists a data set called WeightLossIncentive that has 38 observations on 3 variables. As you interact with R, you will create a series of objects. Sometimes you load them as we have done here, and sometimes you create them yourself as the byproduct of a computation or some analysis you have performed.\nYou can read more details about this data but using the ? command:\n\n?WeightLossIncentive\n\nWe can view the data by typing its name into the console. However printing the whole dataset in the console is not that useful. Instead we can see the top 6 cases with the following command. Type the following line under data(WeightLossIncentive) in your lab report by clicking Enter after the ). Then run it.\n\nhead(WeightLossIncentive)\n\n  WeightLoss   Group Month7Loss\n1       12.5 Control       -2.0\n2       12.0 Control        7.0\n3        1.0 Control       19.5\n4       -5.0 Control       -0.5\n5        3.0 Control       -1.5\n6       -5.0 Control      -10.0\n\n\nOne advantage of RStudio is that it comes with a built-in data viewer. Click on the name WeightLossIncentive in the Environment pane (upper right window) that lists the objects in your workspace. This will bring up an alternative display of the data set in the Data Viewer (upper left window). You can close the data viewer by clicking on the x in the upper lefthand corner.\nWhat you should see are four columns of numbers, each row representing a different person: the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index we can use to access the data from individual people if we want), the second is the amount of weight loss, and the third is the experimental group to which the person was assigned. The fourth is the 7 month follow-up. Each case is a person in this dataset. Use the scrollbar on the right side of the console window to examine the complete data set.\nNote that the row numbers in the first column are not part of the WeightLossIncentive data. R adds them as part of its printout to help you make visual comparisons. You can think of them as the index that you see on the left side of a spreadsheet. In fact, the comparison to a spreadsheet will generally be helpful. R has stored the weightloss incentive data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a data frame.\nYou can see the dimensions (number of rows, the cases, and number of columns, the variables) of this data frame as well as the names of the variables and the first few observations by typing it under glimpse(WeightLossIncentive) and then running it:\n\nglimpse(WeightLossIncentive)\n\nRows: 38\nColumns: 3\n$ WeightLoss &lt;dbl&gt; 12.5, 12.0, 1.0, -5.0, 3.0, -5.0, 7.5, -2.5, 20.0, -1.0, 2.…\n$ Group      &lt;fct&gt; Control, Control, Control, Control, Control, Control, Contr…\n$ Month7Loss &lt;dbl&gt; -2.0, 7.0, 19.5, -0.5, -1.5, -10.0, 0.5, 5.0, 8.5, 18.0, 16…\n\n\nWe can see that there are 38 observations and 3 variables in this dataset. At this point, you might notice that many of the commands in R look a lot like functions from math class; that is, invoking R commands means supplying a function with some number of arguments. The glimpse command, for example, took a single argument, the name of a data frame."

If a question has multiple parts, you can include subheadings including each part. I don’t need the full question, but clearly label the question number.\n\n\n1. Include a chunk of code that loads each of the 5 mentioned packages.\n\n# Green text after a # in a chunk indicates I'm making a comment. \n# when loading packages, I added warning=F and message=F to keep the document looking clean\n# You will be expected to remove all warnings and messages on submitted assignments\n\nAfter you load your packages, don’t forget to load the data.\n\n\n2. What command would you use to extract just the groups that participants were assigned to? Include a chunk with that command\n\n\n3. Does the distribution of weight loss appear normal (i.e., approximately bell-shaped)?\nHow would you describe it (in terms of modality and skew, for example)? (To ensure that your homework is comprehensive, be sure to include the code needed to make the plot as well as your written interpretation. Hint: The code you need is displayed above, you just need to put it in a chunk)\n\n\n4. Which group lost more weight based on the means? Which group has more variability in their weight loss?\nMake sure to include a chunk producing the summary table.\n\n\n5. Do you notice any patterns in these scatterplots? What might that pattern (or lack of pattern) mean, for the weight loss study?\nFor this answer, no code is needed, but I’m looking for a few sentences to answer each part of this question"
