Welcome to Spring 2025 SDS 290: Research Design and Analysis. You will find most of the course content here, but also keep an eye on [Moodle](http://moodle.smith.edu) for grades and assignments. Use the server version of `RStudio` \[\] here\](http://rstudio.smith.edu), although I strongly recommend you install R on your computer ([instructions](https://smithcollege-sds.github.io/sds100/lab_01_setup.html)).

Check the course schedule [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131eOI-EH2uypTRMhCbW6aT2lEGNJbUA2T7GS2MAHOOA/edit?usp=sharing) for assigned readings and major deadlines for the course.
